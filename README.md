How to build  a new component library/framework?

1/ Library: 
Atomic Design
JS only => No TS (just JSdocs my friend...)
That's JUST the library of components
NO CSS. With styling everything is a mess
(scss, css, css modules, ...)
templates potentially in files (BONES)
(1.x) => Storybook like to see components live


2 / Framework
new URLParams
node/deno/bun/...
SSR/ISR/SSG
