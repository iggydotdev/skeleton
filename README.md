How to build  a new component library/framework?

1/ Library (Skeleton)
Atomic Design
JS only => No TS (just JSdocs my friend...)
That's JUST the library of components
NO CSS. With styling everything is a mess
(scss, css, css modules, ...)
templates potentially in files (BONES)
(1.x) => Storybook like to see components live


2 / Framework (Flesh)
new URLParams
node/deno/bun/...
SSR/ISR/SSG

TODOs:

Add:

Organisms:
forms
contentBlocks
carousel?


Molecules:
formInput
radio Group
tabs
tables?
pagination


Templates/ Routes
Homepage finish
Article page
Search results Page (filters somewhere + pagination)
Product detail page
Product listing page


We also need client side js for interactivity. Focus first on tabs.
window.skeleton.tabs
needs to be a singleton
